Namespaces
==========

All the functionality of the library is included within the root ``mppp`` namespace. The name of the root namespace
can be changed by defining the preprocessor directive ``MPPP_CUSTOM_NAMESPACE``. If the custom namespace already
contains other names, the user should ensure that no name collisions occur with mp++'s public API.
